Chunking a large file into smaller pieces is often necessary for various reasons. In this particular case, the script was created to upload personal test data to study Data Analyst GPT, which has a data size limitation of 512 MB. By breaking down the data into smaller chunks, it becomes possible to work within these constraints and ensure smooth processing.

Beyond this specific use case, chunking serves several other important purposes:

Easier Data Transfer: Smaller files are typically easier to transfer over the network, reducing the risk of interruptions and making it more manageable to handle data uploads and downloads.
Manageable Processing: When dealing with large datasets, processing the entire file at once can be resource-intensive and inefficient. Chunking allows for the data to be processed in smaller, more manageable pieces, improving performance and reducing the load on the system.
Parallel Processing: Distributing the workload across multiple systems or processors can significantly speed up data processing. By splitting the file into chunks, it is possible to process each chunk in parallel, thereby optimizing the use of available computational resources.
This script offers a practical solution for these scenarios, making it a valuable tool for anyone working with large CSV files and needing to manage data efficiently.
